# Data Description

* Drifter data: 2020 MEOPAR TREX dataset (all but SVPs)
* Ocean model : GSL500 (gsl500_512_TREX_v3) - three hourly surface currents
* Atmosphere model: Relocatable 1km 

This folder contains correction factor calculations for GSL500 (gsl500_512_TREX_v3) and drifter data provided by the 2020 MEOPAR TREX drifter experiment. The SVP drifters were exlcuded. Drifters with a time gap larger than 6 hours were divided into multiple files. Hourly winds from the 1 km relocatable model were used.
