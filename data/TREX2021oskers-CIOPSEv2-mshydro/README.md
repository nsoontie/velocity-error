# Data Description

* Drifter data: 2021 MEOPAR TREX oskers downloaded from XEOS Oct 4, 2021
* Ocean model : CIOPSEv2 (parallel pass for IC3 CPOP) - hourly surface currents
* Atmosphere model: MSHYDRO

This folder contains correction factor calculations for CIOPSEv2 and osker drifter data from the 2021 MEOPAR TREX drifter experiment.  Drifters with a time gap larger than 6 hours were divided into multiple files. Hourly winds from the 1 km MSHYDRO were used.
