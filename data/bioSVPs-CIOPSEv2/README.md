# Data Description

Drifter data: SVPs from BIO
Ocean model : CIOPSEv2 (run C3E200Y19V3)
Atmosphere model: None

This folder contains correction factor calculations for CIOPSEv2 (C3E200Y19V3) and SVP drifter data provided by BIO (Doug Schillinger). The SVPs are a 15m drougued drifter so winds were not used in these calculations (hence alpha is not computed).
